# Summary

I described the Reactor pattern and presented an implementation in Rust.  The
Reactor pattern is used in concurrent environments so I also described the
threads and channel concept in Rust.

My main task was to design and implement Rust language bindings for syslog-ng.
First, I presented the general concept of language bindings in syslog-ng, then
described its module system. Next, I showed how C and Rust can interact with
each other.

It took several iterations until I was content with the results. I described
the main iteration steps and presented the final result in more details.
